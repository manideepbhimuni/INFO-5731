Bill Hosokawa,"Nisei male. Born in Seattle on January 30, 1915, and attended Washington grade school, Garfield High School and the University of Washington. He grew up as a typical Nisei, working summers in Alaska salmon canneries and Western Avenue produce brokerages to pay for his education. He became interested in writing at Garfield where he was sports editor of the school paper. While attending the University he worked at the weekly Japanese American Courier published by the late Jimmie Sakamoto. A faculty adviser at the University urged Hosokawa to drop out of the journalism school ""because no newspaper in the country would hire a Japanese boy."" Hosokawa rejected the advice, but when he graduated in 1937 he found the professor was right. After working as a male secretary writing letters, Hosokawa and his bride, the former Alice Miyake of Portland, Oregon, went to Singapore in 1938 to help launch an English language daily. A year and a half later Hosokawa moved to Shanghai to work on an American-owned monthly magazine, the Far Eastern Review. Then, sensing the inevitability of war, he returned to Seattle in 1941 just five weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor. When war came, Hosokawa served as executive director of Seattle JACL's Emergency Defense Council helping people in the community to cope. He and his family were removed to the Puyallup Assembly Center, Washington. When other Seattleites were moved to Minidoka concentration camp, Idaho, Hosokawa and his wife and infant son were sent to Heart Mountain, Wyoming. Later, he learned he had been separated from his Seattle friends because he was considered a potential troublemaker. He was in Heart Mountain for 14 months, working as editor of the camp newspaper, the Heart Mountain Sentinel, before being released to join the Des Moines, Iowa Register in 1943. In 1946 he moved to Denver to work on the Denver Post. In 38 years at The Post he held such assignments as executive news editor, assistant managing editor and Sunday editor. He covered the Japanese peace treaty in San Francisco in 1951, the Summit meeting in Paris in 1960 and the Zengakuren student riots in Japan that same year. He also had assignments as war correspondent in Korea and Vietnam, and for 17 years was editor of Empire, the Post's prize-winning Sunday magazine. For his last seven years at the Post Hosokawa was editor of the editorial page -- a Japanese American imprisoned during World War II as a potential security risk who now directed the opinion section of a major American newspaper. After retiring from the Post in 1984 he served the Rocky Mountain News as ombudsman columnist for seven years. Hosokawa has taught journalism classes at the University of Colorado, University of Northern Colorado and University of Wyoming. He wrote a weekly comment column called ""From the Frying Pan"" in JACL's weekly Pacific Citizen from 1942 until 1999. Among other honors, Hosokawa is a former president of the American Association of Sunday and Feature Editors and a member of that organization's Hall of Fame, a charter member of the Denver Press Club Hall of Fame. He was named JACL's Nisei of the Biennium in 1958, and has published 12 books.

Kathy Yamaguchi,"Kathy Yamaguchi (pseudonym) was born in 1948 as a Sansei daughter of a homemaker and a gardener, who had met in the incarceration camp in Topaz, Utah. Yamaguchi calls her father an ""assimilationist"" who mostly associated with non-Asians, and she feels that she, too, did not have a lot of Japanese American friends when she was growing up. When Yamaguchi began to pursue medical education at the University of California, San Francisco, in 1971, she realized how her lack of exposure to professional role models, as well as her experience of growing up in an extremely ""non-verbal"" family, made it a challenge for her to be in a decision-making position. She describes herself as being only ""around on the fringes"" of the Asian American activism in the 1970s. She joined the East Bay Socialist Doctors Group and the Physicians for Social Responsibility, and through members of these groups, she learned in the early 1980s about US survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. She was struck by their graciousness and gratefulness to physicians who offered the needed medical care. ""Given what they've gone through,"" Yamaguchi says, she felt it necessary to assist US hibakusha. She supports a single-payer health care system, and feels that US survivors are one of many groups that have been disadvantaged by the absence of such a system. Yamaguchi also enjoys working with Japanese physicians from Hiroshima who come biannually to conduct a health checkup for American hibakusha. She joined the Sansei Legacy Project beginning in 1990, which put her more in touch with her feelings about being raised by the parents who had been incarcerated during the war. She also made many more Japanese American friends through her participation in the group. At the time of the interview, Yamaguchi worked as a part-time physician in a public clinic serving the underserved patients in San Francisco's Japantown area.",kathy yamaguchi,kathy yamaguchi pseudonym born sansei daughter homemaker gardener met incarceration camp topaz utah yamaguchi call father assimilationist mostly associated nonasians feel lot japanese american friend growing yamaguchi began pursue medical education university california san francisco realized lack exposure professional role model well experience growing extremely nonverbal family made challenge decisionmaking position describes around fringe asian american activism joined east bay socialist doctor group physician social responsibility member group learned early u survivor hiroshima nagasaki bombing struck graciousness gratefulness physician offered needed medical care given theyve gone yamaguchi say felt necessary assist u hibakusha support singlepayer health care system feel u survivor one many group disadvantaged absence system yamaguchi also enjoys working japanese physician hiroshima come biannually conduct health checkup american hibakusha joined sansei legacy project beginning put touch feeling raised parent incarcerated war also made many japanese american friend participation group time interview yamaguchi worked parttime physician public clinic serving underserved patient san franciscos japantown area
Geri Handa,"Geri Handa was born in San Jose, California, in 1948, and studied in the early 1970s at the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Los Angeles, with a focus on community organizing and social services for seniors. She joined Asians for Community Actions in San Jose and worked at Keiro Nursing Home in Los Angeles while she was still attending the school. In the early 1980s, Handa became involved with Friends of Hibakusha, a group created in support of US survivors of the atomic bombings. Since then, she has been one of the most active members of the organization. A Sansei, Handa has worked with Sansei lawyers and attorneys who took interest in US hibakusha from civil rights viewpoints, including Donald K. Tamaki whose oral history is part of this collection. She has worked with representatives of the Asian Law Alliances, the Asian Law Caucus, and the Japanese American Citizens League, in order to secure US government's recognition of US survivors. Although their effort ultimately failed, Handa says that it is ""remarkable"" that US survivors gained recognition and support for treating their radiation illnesses from the Japanese government. She has been a key organizer of the medical checkups conducted by Japanese physicians in San Francisco every other year since 1977. Throughout the interview, Handa emphasizes the importance of community engagement, multiculturalism, and lasting connections made through her work for US hibakusha.",geri handa,geri handa born san jose california studied early school social welfare university california los angeles focus community organizing social service senior joined asian community action san jose worked keiro nursing home los angeles still attending school early handa became involved friend hibakusha group created support u survivor atomic bombing since one active member organization sansei handa worked sansei lawyer attorney took interest u hibakusha civil right viewpoint including donald k tamaki whose oral history part collection worked representative asian law alliance asian law caucus japanese american citizen league order secure u government recognition u survivor although effort ultimately failed handa say remarkable u survivor gained recognition support treating radiation illness japanese government key organizer medical checkup conducted japanese physician san francisco every year since throughout interview handa emphasizes importance community engagement multiculturalism lasting connection made work u hibakusha
Keiko Shinmoto,"Keiko Shinmoto's father migrated from Hiroshima to Portland, Oregon, where his brother was an owner of a grocery store. After returning to Hiroshima to see his ailing father, Keiko's father found it impossible to return to America as his mother hid his passport to keep him in Japan. Shortly, Keiko's mother joined him in Hiroshima, also her hometown. Unlike her eight older siblings, then, Keiko was born in Japan, in 1936. She recalls the challenge of being sent to the countryside at the age of eight as part of shudan sokai, a wartime program for children aiming to protect the youth from fire bombings in cities. The food shortage and black market called yamiichi that flourished after the war, too, left Keiko a strong impression. She is a nyushi survivor, as she was exposed to radiation by walking through the city of Hiroshima three days after the bombing. She lost one of her older sisters to the bomb. She came to the United States in 1960 with a help of her US-born brother, by then living in Los Angeles. She relearned English from her father who was also back in the United States and in the area at that time. Keiko attended a technical college to study design while working as a ""schoolgirl"" and worked briefly in Beverly Hills as a dressmaker before she married Nisei from Stockton. A former prisoner of the Gila River War Relocation Center, he worked as a mechanic at Chevrolet after the war and became an owner of a car repair shop. Keiko helped the shop's book keeping, while she also raised two children and worked at a grocery store in order to pay for her health insurance. At the time of the interview, Keiko had just joined a biannual medical checkup conducted by Hiroshima physicians in San Francisco for the first time because of the encouragement by another US survivor. After her husband passed away in 1998, she has been enjoying talking with her children, going to a Buddhist church in Stockton, and keeping in touch with her Nisei friends.",keiko shinmoto,keiko shinmotos father migrated hiroshima portland oregon brother owner grocery store returning hiroshima see ailing father keikos father found impossible return america mother hid passport keep japan shortly keikos mother joined hiroshima also hometown unlike eight older sibling keiko born japan recall challenge sent countryside age eight part shudan sokai wartime program child aiming protect youth fire bombing city food shortage black market called yamiichi flourished war left keiko strong impression nyushi survivor exposed radiation walking city hiroshima three day bombing lost one older sister bomb came united state help usborn brother living los angeles relearned english father also back united state area time keiko attended technical college study design working schoolgirl worked briefly beverly hill dressmaker married nisei stockton former prisoner gila river war relocation center worked mechanic chevrolet war became owner car repair shop keiko helped shop book keeping also raised two child worked grocery store order pay health insurance time interview keiko joined biannual medical checkup conducted hiroshima physician san francisco first time encouragement another u survivor husband passed away enjoying talking child going buddhist church stockton keeping touch nisei friend
Matsuko Hayashi,"Born in 1921 in Parlier in Fresno County, California, Matsuko Hayashi (pseudonym) grew up as the second oldest of the eight children of a first-generation immigrant who had come to the United States as a sixteen years old, and his wife who had come as a ""picture bride."" They raised grapes on three farms that Matsuko's father and his brother had bought. She remembers her father's affection for the family and his dedication to Buddhism, and how busy her mother was raising children. They hired Mexican laborers and operated their business successfully, winning many blue ribbons for their products at state fairs. Matsuko recalls how the family enjoyed going to camping at Yosemite, and how she went to a Japanese school on Saturdays and Sundays, which she found not effective in teaching her Japanese. As for the American school that she attended on weekdays, she recalls how her teachers were prejudiced against the Japanese. When she went to Japan in 1940, she felt her Japanese classmates were biased against Americans like herself. She and other Nisei at her school in Hiroshima spoke in English, making their Japanese classmate believe that the American students were bad-mouthing their Japanese peers. On August 8, 1945, she was injured and lost consciousness after the bombing, but she survived with the help of her Nisei friend that she knew from a sewing school she had attended in Hiroshima. She lost one of her sisters to the bombing, whom her family was able to identify only because of the white nametag she wore. After losing her Japanese husband to the war, Matsuko came back to the United States in 1947, went to a drapery school and worked in Hollywood as a dressmaker, and was remarried to a Nisei who had been a ""no-no-boy"" in Tule Lake and expressed no concern about the fact that Matsuko is a survivor. As a dedicated Buddhist, Matsuko spent her married life focusing on raising family and working at a nursery, and interacted with other US survivors only occasionally. She feels that being attacked by the bomb was like being hit by tsunami; it was shikata ga nai (It couldn't be helped).",matsuko hayashi,born parlier fresno county california matsuko hayashi pseudonym grew second oldest eight child firstgeneration immigrant come united state sixteen year old wife come picture bride raised grape three farm matsukos father brother bought remembers father affection family dedication buddhism busy mother raising child hired mexican laborer operated business successfully winning many blue ribbon product state fair matsuko recall family enjoyed going camping yosemite went japanese school saturday sunday found effective teaching japanese american school attended weekday recall teacher prejudiced japanese went japan felt japanese classmate biased american like nisei school hiroshima spoke english making japanese classmate believe american student badmouthing japanese peer august injured lost consciousness bombing survived help nisei friend knew sewing school attended hiroshima lost one sister bombing family able identify white nametag wore losing japanese husband war matsuko came back united state went drapery school worked hollywood dressmaker remarried nisei nonoboy tule lake expressed concern fact matsuko survivor dedicated buddhist matsuko spent married life focusing raising family working nursery interacted u survivor occasionally feel attacked bomb like hit tsunami shikata ga nai couldnt helped
Junji Sarashina,"Junji Sarashina was born in 1929 in Lahaina, Hawai'i, the son of a minister of a Buddhist Temple Nishihongan-ji and a teacher of Japanese-style flower arrangement, music, sewing, and cooking. The youngest of five children, Sarashina grew up surrounded by temple members (mostly plantation workers) and their families who enjoyed community picnics and samurai films. When his mother took her children to her hometown of Hiroshima in 1936, Sarashina struggled with Japanese at first. But soon, he got used to things Japanese thanks to the accommodations made by his mother, siblings, and schoolteachers. His older sisters baked Western style cakes and cookies and offered them to Sarashina's schoolmates, helping him to become better accepted. After the Pacific War began, Sarashina's family lost touch with his father who was still in Hawai'i. Later, he learned that his father had been taken by the FBI immediately after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He was sent to the US mainland, then to a number of different incarceration camps. Sarashina as a junior high school student was mobilized to work at an ammunition factory when the nuclear bomb struck Hiroshima. Although he was not injured, he was irradiated as he entered the city to return home. Sarashina suffered diarrhea and could not eat afterward. When he went back to Hawai'i in 1949, he attended high school again to relearn English. Soon, he found a job at a local radio station in Honolulu. During the Korean War, he volunteered to serve as a military intelligence officer. When he was sent to Korea, he was assigned to a unit led by a judo teacher he knew from Sawtelle, California. The teacher had been his older brother's schoolmate in Hiroshima, and so he took Sarashina under his wing throughout Sarashina's stay in Korea. Although Sarashina says that the American government could do more to support US hibakusha, he also says that he supports the medical checkups offered to American survivors by the Japanese government. In fact, he assisted the establishment of the checkup system in the early 1970s and continued to help the US hibakusha's organization called the American Society of Hiroshima-Nagasaki A-bomb Survivors. He takes pride in assisting many US survivors to obtain Japanese hibakusha techo (certificate of survivorhood) and to receive benefits.",junji sarashina,junji sarashina born lahaina hawaii son minister buddhist temple nishihonganji teacher japanesestyle flower arrangement music sewing cooking youngest five child sarashina grew surrounded temple member mostly plantation worker family enjoyed community picnic samurai film mother took child hometown hiroshima sarashina struggled japanese first soon got used thing japanese thanks accommodation made mother sibling schoolteacher older sister baked western style cake cooky offered sarashinas schoolmate helping become better accepted pacific war began sarashinas family lost touch father still hawaii later learned father taken fbi immediately japanese attacked pearl harbor sent u mainland number different incarceration camp sarashina junior high school student mobilized work ammunition factory nuclear bomb struck hiroshima although injured irradiated entered city return home sarashina suffered diarrhea could eat afterward went back hawaii attended high school relearn english soon found job local radio station honolulu korean war volunteered serve military intelligence officer sent korea assigned unit led judo teacher knew sawtelle california teacher older brother schoolmate hiroshima took sarashina wing throughout sarashinas stay korea although sarashina say american government could support u hibakusha also say support medical checkup offered american survivor japanese government fact assisted establishment checkup system early continued help u hibakushas organization called american society hiroshimanagasaki abomb survivor take pride assisting many u survivor obtain japanese hibakusha techo certificate survivorhood receive benefit
Yuriko Furubayashi,"Yuriko Furubayashi was born January 20, 1927, in Waimea, Hawai'i, as one of the ten children of the family. Her father had come to Hawai'i from Hiroshima in the mid-1910s as a contract worker on a pineapple plantation. He grew vegetables and kept chickens around the house to help feed the family. Her mother cooked Japanese food only in part because meat was hard to come by. Many of their co-workers on the plantation were Japanese, and Yuriko used to go to the after-school school at Hongan-ji with these co-workers' children. Her peers at the public school included Filipinos, Chinese, Polynesians, Portuguese, and Haoles. When she was ten years old, her uncle and aunt in Los Angeles, who had been successful owners of Olympic Hotel, took her to Japan. They were childless, so their plan was to make Yuriko the family's heir. Yuriko quickly adjusted to the life in Japan and graduated from high school. She was working in an airplane factory when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Although she was not injured, she was irradiated because she walked through the city on the day after to look for her aunt and uncle. The entire city was still on fire. She saw many corpses and people with severe nuclear burns. She lost one of her uncles to the bomb. She also visited her friend working at an orphanage, and was struck by how many children had lost their parents to the bomb. In 1948, she went to Hawai'i to see her parents, thanks to the arrangement made by her brother who had come to Japan as part of the US occupation force. She decided that she did not want to go back to Hiroshima where memories of the destruction ""depressed"" her. She studied to regain her English and worked at her sister's bakery near Kahoku. She married a baker, and they became successful owners of another bakery named after their oldest son. Yuriko was somewhat worried about radiation effect when she was pregnant with her first child. She gained hibakusha techo (certificate of survivorhood) issued by the Japanese government in the 1960s. She also regularly attends the biannual health checkups conducted by Japanese physicians for American survivors.",yuriko furubayashi,yuriko furubayashi born january waimea hawaii one ten child family father come hawaii hiroshima mids contract worker pineapple plantation grew vegetable kept chicken around house help feed family mother cooked japanese food part meat hard come many coworkers plantation japanese yuriko used go afterschool school honganji coworkers child peer public school included filipino chinese polynesian portuguese haoles ten year old uncle aunt los angeles successful owner olympic hotel took japan childless plan make yuriko family heir yuriko quickly adjusted life japan graduated high school working airplane factory bomb dropped hiroshima although injured irradiated walked city day look aunt uncle entire city still fire saw many corps people severe nuclear burn lost one uncle bomb also visited friend working orphanage struck many child lost parent bomb went hawaii see parent thanks arrangement made brother come japan part u occupation force decided want go back hiroshima memory destruction depressed studied regain english worked sister bakery near kahoku married baker became successful owner another bakery named oldest son yuriko somewhat worried radiation effect pregnant first child gained hibakusha techo certificate survivorhood issued japanese government also regularly attends biannual health checkup conducted japanese physician american survivor
Thomas T. Noguchi,"Thomas Noguchi was the first Japanese American to serve as the Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner of Los Angeles Country. Well-known for conducting autopsies of public figures such as Robert F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and William Holden, Noguchi was in the position between 1967 and 1982. As a Shin Issei immigrant born in Japan (in 1927) and trained in medicine in both Japan and the United States, Noguchi faced racial prejudice especially early in his career, leading to a dismissal from the position in 1969. The Japanese American community and organizations, including the Japanese American Citizens League, made a concerted effort to reinstate him, a campaign that proved successful. Noguchi felt ""grateful,"" and when US survivors ask for his assistance to organize themselves in 1970, he felt as if it was a good opportunity to give back to the community. He enlisted support for US hibakusha from the California State Senator Mervyn Dymally and the U.S. Congressman Edward Roybal. They authored the bills that would have established a publicly funded program for medical care and treatment of radiation illnesses among US survivors. Although both the state and federal bills failed, Noguchi's collaborative effort with the politicians of color reveal changing racial and class relations in the state and national politics in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Noguchi's interview includes a discussion of his work with key leaders of the US survivors' organization, his communication with the JACL, and the public hearings for the medical bills.",thomas noguchi,thomas noguchi first japanese american serve chief medical examinercoroner los angeles country wellknown conducting autopsy public figure robert f kennedy marilyn monroe william holden noguchi position shin issei immigrant born japan trained medicine japan united state noguchi faced racial prejudice especially early career leading dismissal position japanese american community organization including japanese american citizen league made concerted effort reinstate campaign proved successful noguchi felt grateful u survivor ask assistance organize felt good opportunity give back community enlisted support u hibakusha california state senator mervyn dymally u congressman edward roybal authored bill would established publicly funded program medical care treatment radiation illness among u survivor although state federal bill failed noguchi collaborative effort politician color reveal changing racial class relation state national politics late early noguchi interview includes discussion work key leader u survivor organization communication jacl public hearing medical bill
Paul Satoh,"Born in Osaka, Japan, in 1936, Paul Satoh spent a happy childhood as the only child of a chemist and a homemaker. Satoh's extended family included an uncle who had studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his wife, a US-born Nikkei from Hawai'i who occasionally had received a ""care pack from the United States"" that she shared with the Satohs. Although the couple was not affected by the bomb as they were in Tokyo, one of Satoh's other aunts who was in Hiroshima died of radiation sickness. Satoh himself, too, was in Hiroshima as his family's house in Osaka was burned in an air raid early in 1945. Living in his relative's house in Koi, which was about six kilometer from the hypocenter, Satoh remembers hearing a ""real big sound"" at the moment of the explosion. His family decided to take refuge in his grandmother's house in the countryside, and as they walked through Hiroshima, they witnessed people dying on the street from severe burns and injuries. Many years later, his mother died of leukemia, while Satoh himself suffered from thyroid cancer. Immediately after the war, though, Satoh recalled only silence around the bomb, even as many of his classmates passed away because of the delayed radiation effect. He came to the United States in 1960 to study chemistry at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. He married a Polish American woman who was his classmate, and experienced racial discrimination in the era when interracial marriages were still illegal in many US states. Satoh also found that his brother-in-law had worked as a maintenance crew for Enola Gay, the airplane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. Satoh worked as a chemist in the for-profit sector, and he occasionally lectured at colleges on applied chemistry. Although he was not part of any US survivors' groups, he was interested in issues of nuclear weaponry and bomb victims. He has assisted research for a book written by his acquaintance about US prisoners of war who died of the bomb in Hiroshima in 1945.",paul satoh,born osaka japan paul satoh spent happy childhood child chemist homemaker satohs extended family included uncle studied university california los angeles wife usborn nikkei hawaii occasionally received care pack united state shared satohs although couple affected bomb tokyo one satohs aunt hiroshima died radiation sickness satoh hiroshima family house osaka burned air raid early living relative house koi six kilometer hypocenter satoh remembers hearing real big sound moment explosion family decided take refuge grandmother house countryside walked hiroshima witnessed people dying street severe burn injury many year later mother died leukemia satoh suffered thyroid cancer immediately war though satoh recalled silence around bomb even many classmate passed away delayed radiation effect came united state study chemistry wayne state university detroit michigan married polish american woman classmate experienced racial discrimination era interracial marriage still illegal many u state satoh also found brotherinlaw worked maintenance crew enola gay airplane dropped bomb hiroshima satoh worked chemist forprofit sector occasionally lectured college applied chemistry although part u survivor group interested issue nuclear weaponry bomb victim assisted research book written acquaintance u prisoner war died bomb hiroshima
